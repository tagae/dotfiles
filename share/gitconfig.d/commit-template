# Subject line (50 characters, capitalised phrase)
#
# Explanatory text (72 characters, wrapped). This should answer:
#
# * Why is this change necessary?
# * How does it address the issue?
# * Are there any side effects?
#
# Include a link to the ticket, if any.
#
# Use imperative commit message: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed bug" or "Fixes
# bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
# commands like git merge and git revert.
#
# As a convention, use markdown syntax when necessary.
