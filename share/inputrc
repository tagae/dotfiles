# ~/.inputrc: readline initialization file.

# For more information on how this file works, please see the
# INITIALIZATION FILE section of the readline(3) man page
#
# This file controls the behaviour of line input editing for programs that use
# the GNU Readline library, such as Bash and GDB.
#
# You can re-read the inputrc file with C-x C-r.

# First, include any system-wide bindings and variable
# assignments from /etc/inputrc
$include /etc/inputrc

# Emacs-style editing
set editing-mode emacs
